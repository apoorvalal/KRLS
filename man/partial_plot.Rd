\title{Plot partial dependence of the  marginal effects}
\usage{
partial_plot(obj, xcol, derivcol = NULL, nlocations = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{krls2} object}

\item{xcol}{An integer specifying the column of the data we should plot the partial dependence function of (this is the S variable)}

\item{derivcol}{An integer that specifies what kind of partial dependence plot should be generated. If left blank, the conditional expectation function is plotted; if specified the partial derivative of the CEF with respect to that column in the data is plotted.}

\item{nlocations}{An integer with the number of locations to plot the function at, defaults to 30 over the range of the relevant variable}
